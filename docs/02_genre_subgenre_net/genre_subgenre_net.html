                This visualization invites you to explore the intricate relationships between music genres and their
                subgenres.
                The Sankey diagram visually maps out how major genres branch into their respective subgenres,
                offering insights into the diversity and evolution of musical styles, as well as the cross-influences
                between different genres.
                It serves as a dynamic overview of how music has grown, blended, and diversified over time.
